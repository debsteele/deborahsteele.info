title: Welcome

I am a [**marine microbiologist**](/marine-microbiology), [**LC-MS specialist**](/LC-MS) and [**algae enthusiast**](/algae). Currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Millennium Institute of Oceanography](http://en.imo-chile.cl/), Chile. I use experimental methods and in-situ measurements to investigate the responses of algae to stressful environments, and to calssify and quantify phytoplankton assemblages.

## Projects

### Phytoplankton of the South Pacific
*Principal Investigator*, 2015-2016

I have set-up a facility for **HPLC/MS** analyses of algal **photosynthetic pigments**, at the Chemistry Laboratory of Natural Products, at the University of Concepcion, Chile.

After gathering marine samples from a transect from the Chilean Coast to Rapanui (Easter Island) and around the Juan Fernandez seamounts, I'm assessing phytoplanktin **community structures** using chemotaxonomy (CHEMTAX).

This work is also being intergrated into size-class analysis for use in primary productivity estimates of the region by [A. Carredor](http://en.imo-chile.cl/team/corredor-andrea.html).

### Adapting to a Changing Ocean
*Collaborator*, 2015-2016

Investigating the **functional responses** of algae to the CO<sub>2</sub> conditions predicted by **climate change** models, with the Principal Investigator - [C. Vargas](http://en.imo-chile.cl/team/vargas-cristian.html), using a CO<sub>2</sub> mesocosm.
