* Principal Investigator: D.J. Steele
* Title: Phytoplankton of the eastern South Pacific - classification by Chemotaxonomy
* Duration: 1.5 years from March 2015
* Collaborators: [C.E. Morales](http://en.imo-chile.cl/team/morales-carmen.html)
* Funding: Postdoctoral Fellowship [FONDECYT](http://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/), funded by [CONICYT](http://www.conicyt.cl/), Chile
* Hosted by the [Millennium Institute of Oceanography](http://en.imo-chile.cl/), University of Concepćion, Chile

### Set-up of LCMS facility for Photosynthetic Pigment Analysis.
To begin this project I initialed a new LC-MS facility for the identification of 25 photosynthetic pigments with quantification of 15. Using an underused instrument in the Chemistry of Natural Products Laboratory, University of Concepćion.

#### Technical Details
Equiptment:
* Shimadzu LCMS 2020 (single quadropole) with APCI source.
* Standards from DHI (2016)

### Study Sites
Sea Mounts Juan Fernandez mountains 5 (JF5), 6 (JF6) and O Higgins.
Transect Puerto Flamenco, Chile to Rapanui (Easter Island).

### Phytoplankton Chemotaxonomy
Analysis with CHEMTAX using microscopic observations.
